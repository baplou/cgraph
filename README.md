## A xy graph for command line tools in python

This is matplotlib for command line tools. It allows you to make a basic xy graph for a terminal interface instead of a GUI.

For defining the xy borders of the graph use `.setup(x,y)`.
For plotting a point in the graph use `.plot(x,y)`.
For printing the graph use `.show()`.

* **Things to keep in mind**
  * You **can** plot multiple points in the graph.
  * You must `.setup()` the graph before showing or plotting.
  * Right now this only works with integers and single digits.
  * If you plot something thats out of reach of the graph borders the program will throw an error.

* **Upcoming features**
  * titles for x and y borders
  * compatability with double digits
  * compatability with floats
  * Bar graphs (maybe)
